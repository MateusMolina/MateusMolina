ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm an engineer, researcher, and producer based in Kaiserslautern. I:

(1) [work and research on the topic of digital twins and MBSE](https://github.com/mateusmolina-iese);

(2) produce music I'm still afraid of publishing - mostly rock/metal

(3) maintain a [strange mixture of blog and second brain](http://mateusmolina.github.io/)

(4) game dev in the spare time
