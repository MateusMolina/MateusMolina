ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm an engineer and researcher based in Kaiserslautern. I:

(1) work and research on the topic of [AAS, digital twins](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-java-server-sdk) and MBSE;

(2) produce music I'm still afraid of publishing - mostly rock/metal

(3) maintain a [strange mixture of blog and second brain](http://mateusmolina.github.io/)

(4) game dev in the spare time
